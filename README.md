##California House Price Prediction using Machine Learning | Purwadhika Digital Technology School (_May 2024 - May 2024_)
[Publications](https://github.com/MevlanaDimas/Purwadhika_Capstone_Project_3.git)

🏡 **Predicting California House Prices with Machine Learning** 📈

As the real estate market continues to evolve, accurate predictions of house prices become essential for buyers, sellers, and investors. 🌟

In this exciting project, we harnessed the power of **machine learning** to forecast house prices in the sunny state of California. 🌴🏠

Our journey involved:
1. **Data Collection**: We gathered extensive data on housing features, location, and historical prices.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Crafting meaningful features from raw data to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: We explored various algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and XGBoost.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning our models for optimal accuracy.
5. **Validation**: Rigorous cross-validation to ensure robustness.

This model may can help:

- Understand Market Trends: By predicting house prices, we can identify trends of price increases or decreases in specific regions. This information assists both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
- Financial Planning: Price predictions enable individuals and families to plan home purchases wisely. For instance, knowing the estimated future house prices aids in savings and financing planning.
- Property Investment: For investors, predicting house prices helps in selecting potentially profitable properties. Understanding the factors influencing prices allows for smarter decision-making.
- Housing Policies: Government and related institutions can use house price predictions to design effective and sustainable housing policies.

The result? still not perfect because this model is overfitting, so I not recomended using directly but feel free to pull my code. Whether you're a homebuyer, seller, or investor, our insights can guide your decisions. 📊💡

Stay tuned for more exciting data science adventures! 🚀🔍
